### Pathogenic Stage ###
* stage is determined by tumor size, number of tumors found and where
  the cancer has spread
Stage I: cancer is found early, is in one lung, has not spread to LN. Localized
Stage II: found early but has spread inside or just ouside of one lung
  and may have spread to nearby LN on samde side of the body. Regional spread.
Stage III: cancer found in one lung and has spread to the chest and LN
  further further away from the lungs. Regional spread.
Stage IV: advanced cancer and has spread to the lining or fluid around 
  the heart or lungs, or has spread to distant parts of the body. 
  Includes having tumors in both lungs, no matter the size of the tumors.

### Tumor size ###
TX: size cannot be assessed - too small for testing
T1: <3cm diameter, only in lungs 
T1a: <1cm, have not reached tissues surrounding lung/main branches of the
  airways
T1b: 1-2cm, have not reached tissues surrounding lung/main branches of the
  airways
T2: 3-5cm, grown into main bronchus/inner lining of lungs or caused lung 
  collapse or swelling. 
T2a: 3-4cm, grown into main airways and/or tissue around the lungs
T2b: 4-5cm, grown into main airways and/or tissue around the lungs
T3: 5-7cm, growth beyond primary site, into chest wall/ nearby site or
  other tumors in the same lobe of the lung
T4: >7cm, extensive tumor growth, invading nearby structures/organs. Growth
  into center of chest, to the diaphragm, heart or its major blood vessels,
  windpipe, esophagus, spine or other tumors in same lobe of the lung
  
### Presence of distant metastasis ###
MX: not evaluated 
M0: no distant metastasis, cancer not spread beyond site of origin/ nearby LN.
  Localized.
M1a: presence of metastasis to distant sites within the same lung/pleura.
  Regional.
M1b: metastasis to distant sites beyong lung and pleura, ex. brain, liver,
  bones. Distant. 
  
### Lymph Node (LN) involvement ###
NX: LN cannot be assessed
N0: no regional LN metastasis, cancer not spread to LN
N1: involvement of regional LN
N2: more extensive LN involvement

### Treatment type ###
Pharmaceutical therapy 
Radiation Therarpy (RT)

(AJCC, 2017)
Stage I = T1 to T2a, N0, M0
Stage II = T1 to T3, N0 to N1, M0
Stage III = T1 to T4, N0 to N3, M0
Stage IV = Any T, Any N, M1s
